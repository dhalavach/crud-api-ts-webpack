NB: production build is not working properly, please do not use npm run build script!

to start the server in dev mode:
1. npm install
2. npm run start:dev

to run tests:
1. npm run test 
(also do  npm install if you have done it before)


The server will be listening on port 5000 (by default). 
There is no frontend with UI, please use Postman for testing

Cheers!
